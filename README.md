## Inventory Management System for Pleasant Grove Farms

Our team is building a simple and efficient inventory management system for Pleasant Grove Farms. Their current process relies on the management of spreadsheets. This makes it difficult to keep track of what they have in stock. Our system will make it easier for them by having everything they need in an intuitive and organized interface.

Key solutions:

* A clean, easy-to-use dashboard to view and update inventory
  Real-time updates so they always know what is in stock
  Separate access for admins and regular users to keep things secure
* A reliable database to store all their product, user, and sales info
  Secure login system with password protection

What makes our team’s solution unique:

 * No unnecessary complexity
 * Next.js and PostgreSQL for speed and reliability
 * Serverless — cheaper to host and easier to maintain
 * Designed to grow with their needs — we can always add more features later
